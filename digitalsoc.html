										<h2>About the program</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The digital product innovation project is the main theme of the #tech4Impact program. 
										From the start of the program, participants were immediately divided into groups and 
										went through the stages of analyzing a product. Starting from design thinking hat for brainstorming, 
										crazy 8's, odyssey plans, prototypes, outline information architecture, wireframes then move on to
										fullstack (front-end and back-end) web development. 
										After we were all equipped with intensive training for 4 months, we utilized existing technological 
										knowledge to solve our partner's challenge problems. Here I choose the ASEAN Youth Organization
										—which in my opinion—the scope of the problem is wider than others.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Note: This program is still running and the process is not finalized until January next year.</b>

										<h2>Analayze the problem</h2>
									</header>
									<p>AYO focuses on youth social issues in Southeast Asia. In achieving its goals, 
										AYO wants to provide a platform for them to raise their concerns. Without proper channels 
										for young people to voice their opinions, outdated views and practices will potentially harm 
										today's youth. AYO believes that by ensuring the proper handling of youth issues and youth 
										rights to relevant policy makers, this is one way for them to ensure the future existence 
										of all of us. As a generation to be leaders, AYO wants to ensure that today's youth have 
										a channel to participate and mobilize their talents, ideas and skills to create a better society.
									</p>
									<p>
										With pandemic issue, global warming, and climate change—a platform to enable sustainable and impactful 
										collaboration between civil society in ASEAN is also a necessity. Not only that, AYO is currently 
										experiencing problems related to tracking orientation and completing the program for each applicant 
										with 3 levels: 1. Persons with disabilities who are not part of NGOs or organizations of persons with 
										disabilities, 2. Persons with disabilities who are part of NGOs or organizations of persons with 
										disabilities, 3. Non-disabled individuals. Those problems cause AYO have to spend time and effort 
										answering questions and creating emails asking for proof, calling or texting for more information 
										about these people.
									</p>
									<p>
										International organizations already exist, but they have no links to grassroots organizations and the lack 
										of English proficiency in some countries, especially in rural areas, makes it difficult for existing 
										businesses.The lack of sense of belonging especially in the ASEAN region makes it increasingly difficult 
										to create a common vision and identity. Thus, it creates a gap between stakeholders. 
										The government is aware of the problem and provides solutions, but the awareness to address 
										the problem as a community does not yet exist.
									</p>
									<p>
										In support of friends with disabilities, the use of ready-made chatbots with CRM and low code solutions 
										can be implemented, but implementation is problematic because AYO requires integration of social media 
										and email to reduce time for volunteers and administrators. The solution can be done temporarily, 
										but the current difficulty makes it impossible to do it alone with the lack of resources and time.

										<h2>Highlight</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										In solving the problem, the big picture can be drawn into the following questions: <br />
										1. How does AYO connect with grassroots organizations?<br />
										2. How to break down language and cultural barriers to better communicate with youth around the world? <br />
										3. How to increase awareness of regional identity as well as global identity to address common problems? <br />
										4. How to address orientation issues in the due diligence process for persons with disabilities who may be eligible for our program? <br />
										5. How to answer questions asked by individuals to select the right program and support for them? <br />
										6. How to reduce the time and effort to track various individuals during the orientation process for the program? <br />

										<h2>Solutions</h2>

									<p>
										After going through a long discussion, disassembling solutions, then re-analyzing the problem, 
										my group decided to create a forum and search for a community feature. 
										We know this is a social issue, for which  accommodations are needed.	
										This solution will be made into a web-based application, with additional support 
										features for people with disabilities.

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										The results of the activity involve aspects of hard skills and soft skills (in points): <br />
										1. In the process, we have used many platforms as learning media, such as Figma, Miro, Notion, and Github. <br />
										2. Interview with direct resources. These resources are used before and after the product prototype is ready to be tested. The first is from @difabelzone.id, a community based in Yogyakarta, their activity is making handicrafts. In interviews, we studied their conditions during the pandemic which resulted in reduced visits from foreign tourist, their communities which were generally less exposed. As per our original goal, we want to see the point of view from many sides. So we used a second resource, a student who represents youth and how they want to achieve. Communicating with them allows us to empathize with their difficulties and how products can be made to solve their problems. <br />
										3. Pitching the product with facilitator and reporting each process to the challenge partner. <br />
